An Appointment Scheduler That Gets Out Of Your Way

== Description ==

Better Appointment fills a need found while looking at other appointment
scheduling plugins and form builders for Wordpress. I couldn't find a simple
and clean plugin for setting up a simple appointment scheduling form.
Better Appointment makes scheduling appointments a breeze for you and your customers.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `better-appointment.zip` folder and extract it to `wp-content/plugins`
2. Activate the plugin under the 'Plugins' menu in your Wordpress admin dashboard.
3. Add the [better-appointment] shortcode to your intended page.
4. Configure the settings under the 'Better Appointment' menu in your Wordpress admin dashboard.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I customize the layout or fields in the form? =

The free version of Better Appointment does not include the ability to edit the form layout.
You can upgrade to the premium version <a href="https://demayowebdevelopment.com/plugin/better-appointment-pro">here</a>.

= Where can I view tutorials for how to use this plugin? =

We are currently working on some tutorial videos which will be posted on our YouTube channel.

= What features are in the pipeline? =

Over the next few months, we'll be working on Google Calendar integration,
setting availability, periodic reminder emails, and more.
